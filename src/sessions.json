For example, you can build a predictive model in Amazon SageMaker for scene detection analysis and then run it locally on an AWS Greengrass enabled security camera device where there is no cloud connectivity to predict and send an alert when an incoming visitor is detected.

However, much of the publicized tools and articles focus on killing Amazon EC2 instances, and the efforts in the serverless community have been largely limited to moving those tools into Lambda functions. How can we apply the same principles of chaos to a serverless architecture built around AWS Lambda functions? Can we adapt existing practices to expose the inherent chaos in these systems? What are the limitations and new challenges that we need to consider? Come to this session and find out.\n\nThis session is part of re:Invent Developer Community Day, a series led by AWS enthusiasts who share first-hand, technical insights on trending topics. ",

You then explore these logs with Kibana, building a dashboard to gain visibility into your application service and monitor key parameters of your application. ",

In this chalk talk, AWS and Fast.ai will share best practices on how to optimize AWS infrastructure to minimize deep learning training times by using distributed/multi-node training. ",

In this session, we show you how to get started with the natural language processing (NLP) techniques using Amazon SageMaker, a platform to easily build, train, and deploy models at scale. We review all of the NLP-related algorithms available on Amazon SageMaker, including Amazon algorithms (Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Neural Topic Model (NTM), and Sequence2Sequence (seq2seq), and BlazingText). We dive into the details, and we run through an example Jupyter Notebook that uses these algorithms. ",

Participants in this builder session learn to use Amazon SageMaker, an AWS service that simplifies the ML process and enables training on cloud-stored datasets at any scale. Attendees walk through the process of building a model, training it, and applying it for prediction against large open scientific datasets, such as the 1000 Genomes data. By the end of the session, attendees have the resources and experience to start using Amazon SageMaker and related AWS services to accelerate their scientific research and time to discovery. ",

Common hybrid cloud use cases, such as cloud migration, data center extension, disaster recovery, and cloud bursting require data integration, resources and deployment management integration, security and identity integration, and devices and edge systems integration as the foundational components of a hybrid cloud landing zone. In this session, we dive deep on the networking, security, account management structure, operating model, and management configuration best practices to build your own hybrid cloud landing zone. There is 80% commonality across all these hybrid cloud uses cases, but 20% of them are unique. We dive deep on the nuances for each of these use cases to provide different hybrid cloud landing zone lenses on top of the core hybrid cloud landing zone. ",

The goal here is to examine the fundamentals of identity, data partitioning, and tenant isolation through the lens of a working solution and highlight the challenges and strategies associated with building a next-generation SaaS application on AWS. We’ll look at the full lifecycle of registering new tenants, applying security policies to prevent cross-tenant access, and leveraging tenant profiles to effectively distribute and partition tenant data.

Executives can get a flash briefing at the start of their day with key metrics describing the business' overall health, and then use private skills to drill down on that information, visualizing it via cards or through browser control. Gain an understanding of cards and ways to approach browser control, and build a basic private skill integration with Tableau using browser control. ",
